Alternative styling for the 2019 Style panel UI of the Webflow Designer app.

Makes some labels disappear, enlarge some items, give some items some colors to differenciate them, increase the contrast
on some UI items. Text labels are styled in San Francisco, with a heavier weight and an alignment to their respective field.

There is also a set of styles to secure the workflow of importing large CSVs into CMS collections with a lot of fields.
It reduces the number of clicks and drags, potentially reducing the possibility of making errors when binding or creating
fields, and when setting the values for switch fields (because the binding of Yes and No on the switches fields is not 
predictable).

- Increases the height of the fields dropdown menus in order not to have to scroll inside of them, making the switches
red in order to never miss one
- Adds a significant padding on the bottom of the UI to cope with the taller dropdown menu. 

Those styles are commented out. You shouldn't use those styles by default, althought they break nothing.
